Hi, I'm Anthony, a frontend engineer from Peru. I have spent the last 2 years developing web applications with the latest and greatest technologies in the industry. My projects provide great value, since I focus on the end user experience without neglecting the technical aspects.

I am curious and self-taught. Everything I know about web development I have learned on the Internet. I am always researching new libraries, frameworks and services for my projects. When I'm starting with a topic, I check courses, tutorials and videos on YouTube. When I want to learn something thoroughly, I check its official documentation.

I am looking forward to a challenging position with a prestigious company that furthers my learning and help me to grow as a professional.
