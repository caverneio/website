I'm a software engineer based in Peru.

I'm interested in web development, computer vision, and user/dev experience.

I'm looking for opportunities to grow as a developer working on innovative projects. If you have one, please contact me.

## My programming journey

My first experience with programming was when I was 15 (2017). I wanted to build a website for my family business, so I downloaded Brackets and started learning HTML and CSS. I didn't know what I was doing, but I was fascinated by the fact that I could write some code and see something nice in the browser.

Later on, when I was 16 (2018), I took a robotics class and wrote some C on an Arduino board. Again, I didn't know what I was doing (I just copied the code the teacher told me to my laptop), but I was so excited to see the lights turning on.

When I was 17 (2019), I started college and took my first computer science class. I was hooked. I learned about algorithms, data structures, and programming paradigms. I wrote a lot of Python and C++, and _finally_, I understood what I was doing.

When I was 18 (2020) and the pandemic started, I found myself with a lot of free time. One day I saw "The Social Network" movie and, with a lot of motivation, I decided to learn web development. So I took a course and built a few projects. I learned about HTML, CSS, and Django.

I tried PHP with Laravel. I met React and soon fell in love with working with it. I met GraphQL. I built a few apps with this stack. Then (2021), I learned about Next.js. I built an app with it and deployed it to Vercel. It was my first time deploying something to the internet. I was so happy and proud of myself.

Last year (2022), I got my first job as a software engineer. I worked at Hunter Lojack as a Backend Engineer and contributed to the development of internal APIs.

This year (2023), I worked as a Full-stack Engineer at Primax, where I developed an application for the HR Department.

I made a lot of projects during this whole time. From to-do apps to social networks. If interested, check them out here.
