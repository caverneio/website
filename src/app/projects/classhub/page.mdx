A social network for students

As a college student, I have always had the need to share information with my classmates. Sometimes, there are important things every college student should know, like the date of an exam, the deadline of a project, etc.

## A social network for students

I'm actively working on Classhub, a social network exclusively for students. At registration, the user must enter a valid university email address. This way, we can ensure that only students can register.

## Features

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: home_img,
      alt: "Home",
      screen: "mobile",
    },
    {
      src: create_img,
      alt: "Create",
      screen: "mobile",
    },
    {
      src: search_img,
      alt: "Search",
      screen: "mobile",
    },
    {
      src: profile_img,
      alt: "Profile",
      screen: "mobile",
    },
    {
      src: following_img,
      alt: "Following",
      screen: "mobile",
    },
    {
      src: light_img,
      alt: "Light",
      screen: "mobile",
    },
    {
      src: desktop_img,
      alt: "Desktop",
      screen: "desktop",
    },
  ]}

- [x] **Create posts**: You can create posts with images, text, and code snippets.
- [x] **Search**: You can search for posts by title, content, or tags.

## How it works

it's so cool `hello()`

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/pages/api/posts/[id]/images.ts"  {6-10, 13}
let images = [];

let i = 0;
while (true) {
  let file = form_data.get(`file-${i}`);
  let alt = form_data.get(`alt-${i}`);

  if (!file) {
    break;
  }

  file = file as File;

  let fileName: string = file.name;
  let mimeType = file.type;
  let fileData = Buffer.from(await file.arrayBuffer());

  images.push({
    alt: alt ? alt.toString() : null,
    file: {
      name: fileName,
      mediaType: mimeType,
      base64Content: fileData.toString("base64"),
    },
    status: newStatus.id,
  });

  i++;
}

await xata.db.image.create(images);
```
