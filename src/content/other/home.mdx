## My programming journey

Back in 2017, when I was a curious 15-year-old, I had my initial foray into the world of programming. It all began with a simple yet ambitious goal: I wanted to create a website for my family's business. Armed with Brackets, I took my first steps in learning HTML and CSS. To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing at the time, but the sheer thrill of writing code and seeing it come to life in the browser was absolutely captivating.

The following year, at the ripe age of 16 in 2018, I found myself in a robotics class. I dipped my toes into C programming, primarily on an Arduino board. Admittedly, I was more of a code copier than a coder at this point, following my teacher's instructions. Nevertheless, the sheer delight of watching those lights blink to my commands was exhilarating.

When I turned 17 in 2019, I entered college and took my very first computer science class. That's when the real magic happened. I dove headfirst into the world of algorithms, data structures, and programming paradigms. I wrestled with Python and grappled with C++, and finally, the pieces began to click into place. I started understanding what I was doing.

Then came the tumultuous year of 2020, marked by the pandemic. It was during this period that I found myself with an abundance of free time. One fateful day, I stumbled upon "The Social Network" movie, and it triggered an intense motivation to dive into web development. I promptly enrolled in a course and embarked on numerous projects. HTML, CSS, and Django became my constant companions.

I ventured into PHP with Laravel, crossed paths with React, and instantly, I was smitten. The allure of GraphQL also beckoned me. As 2021 rolled around, I encountered Next.js, which led me to create and deploy my very first web application on Vercel. Witnessing my creation live on the internet was a profoundly satisfying experience that filled me with a sense of accomplishment.

In 2022, I hit a significant milestone by landing my first gig as a software engineer at Hunter Lojack. I worked diligently as a Backend Engineer, making valuable contributions to the development of crucial internal APIs. It was a remarkable learning experience.

Fast forward to the present year, 2023. I've been donning the hat of a Full-stack Engineer at Primax, where I've been busy developing an application for the HR Department. It's been a whirlwind journey of growth and discovery.

Throughout this remarkable odyssey, I've undertaken a multitude of projects, ranging from humble to-do apps to ambitious social networks. If you're curious to explore them, you can find them all right [here](/projects).
