# UTEC Classrooms

I am currently studying at the University of Engineering and Technology (UTEC).

On campus, there are some places where students can study or work outside of their enrolled classes. These places include the library, cubicles, and classrooms without scheduled events or classes.

<Aside emoji="üí°">
  From now on, we will refer to classes and any bookings, including maintenance,
  office hours, and external events that are scheduled in specific classrooms,
  as `events`.
</Aside>

Outside every classroom, there is a printed QR code that links to a Google Drive folder containing schedules for events in each classroom in PDF files.

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/folder-1.png",
      alt: "Screenshot of the folder with the schedules organized by floors",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/folder-2.png",
      alt: "Screenshot of the folder with the schedules of the classrooms in the eight floor",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/folder-3.png",
      alt: "Screenshot of the schedule of the classroom A803. A pdf file.",
    },
  ]}
/>

This folder is updated on weekends. So, if a new event is created on Monday, students won't see it in the folder until the following week.

Until recently, there was no direct way to find a free classroom on campus. If a student wanted to find one, they had to check the schedules of several classrooms until they found an available one.

UTEC Classrooms is the solution to this problem.

With this web application, students can now easily see which classrooms are free at any given time.

In this article, I'll discuss some interesting challenges I encountered while building this app and how I overcame them. Additionally, I'll share user engagement statistics, including a significant peak, and explain the strategies we're employing to continue expanding our user base.

## Data

I've spoken with some friends and classmates about the app, and one question they all have in common is, "How did you get the data?"

Data is crucial for this application.

First, let's examine how much data we're dealing with.

The following code snippet retrieves the events in classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023.

<Aside emoji="üëÄ">
  Note that in lines 13 and 18, we're creating datetime instances in UTC, which
  is 5 hours behind Lima timezone.
</Aside>

```js showLineNumbers {13,18,29,30}
import { getXataClient } from "./xata";
let xata = getXataClient();

let events = await xata.db.event
  .select(["name", "course.name", "start", "end"])
  .filter({
    $all: [
      {
        "classroom.name": "A803",
      },
      {
        start: {
          $ge: new Date("2023-10-03T11:00:00Z"), // October 3rd, 6:00 AM in Lima
        },
      },
      {
        end: {
          $le: new Date("2023-10-04T03:00:00Z"), // October 3rd, 10:00 PM in Lima
        },
      },
    ],
  })
  .getAll();

let data = events
  .sort((a, b) => a.start.getHours() - b.start.getHours())
  .map((e) => ({
    name: e.name || e.course?.name,
    start: e.start?.toLocaleTimeString("en-US", { timeZone: "America/Lima" }),
    end: e.end?.toLocaleTimeString("en-US", { timeZone: "America/Lima" }),
  }));

console.log(data);
```

Also note that in lines 29 and 30, we're converting the datetime instances to strings using the `toLocaleTimeString` method. This is because we want to show the time in the LIma timezone.

And the output is:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Procesamiento y M√©todos de Im√°genes Biom√©dicas",
    "start": "7:00:00 AM",
    "end": "9:00:00 AM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Biotransporte",
    "start": "9:00:00 AM",
    "end": "10:00:00 AM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Laboratorio de Comunicaci√≥n 2",
    "start": "10:00:00 AM",
    "end": "12:00:00 PM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Matem√°ticas Discretas I",
    "start": "12:00:00 PM",
    "end": "2:00:00 PM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Din√°mica y Vibraciones",
    "start": "2:00:00 PM",
    "end": "4:00:00 PM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Qu√≠mica Org√°nica Aplicada",
    "start": "4:00:00 PM",
    "end": "6:00:00 PM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Estrategia Competitiva",
    "start": "6:00:00 PM",
    "end": "8:00:00 PM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Introducci√≥n a Sistemas Embebidos",
    "start": "8:00:00 PM",
    "end": "10:00:00 PM"
  }
]
```

Here's what the data looks like in the UTEC Classrooms app:

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/2023-10-03_A803.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
  mobile
/>

As you can see, there are 8 events in classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023.

Can you guess how many events are happening across the entire campus that day? Well, there are a lot‚Äî201 events, to be exact. And that's just for one day. We need to retrieve events for the entire week and month, so we're dealing with a substantial amount of data.

To efficiently handle this volume of data, we've opted to use a database, which brings us to the next question:

### How Do We Retrieve the Data?

Initially, my idea was to build a program to scrape data from the PDF files in the Google Drive folder. However, I soon realized this was a challenging task due to the varied PDF formats.

While examining the PDFs, I noticed that they appeared to be "printed" from a web page (I observed the "Buscar" and "Imprimir" buttons).

Over the next few days, I searched for the web page used to generate these PDFs, and I found it:

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/reserva-intranet-ss-1.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

It turns out that there's a web app at `reserva-intranet.utec.edu.pe`, accessible only to signed-in users. In the `/reserva/calendarioaula` route, users can select a classroom, click "Buscar," and within seconds, the app displays the events in that classroom.

<Aside emoji="üöÄ">
  As you will see bellow, in order to understand how this app is designed, we
  need to interact a lot with it and keep track of what's happening behind the
  scenes (with the requests, logs, etc). This process is known as **reverse
  engineering**.
</Aside>

Let's reverse engineer this app.

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/fetch-request-utec-api.gif"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

When clicking the `Buscar` button, the app makes a `GET` request to retrieve the events. I wanted to replicate this request from outside `reserva-intranet.utec.edu.pe`, so I tried making the request in [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/).

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/request-hoppscotch.gif"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

JSON Response:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1696782429333,
  "uuid": "c682f113-7626-4678-8154-ec8d1de6fdf6",
  "status": 401,
  "message": "Token validation failed. Validation endpoint return an error code [9006] with this message [Parameter was not found in request. X-Auth-Token is required.]. Operation id [871d83d0-65f7-11ee-bdd4-0242ac11000b]",
  "managed": true
}
```

However, the request <span id="how-to-get-the-token">failed</span> because we didn't send the `X-Auth-Token` header.

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/fetch-request-utec-api-headers.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

We can find this token as a header in the original request. We can copy and add it to our request in Hoppscotch:

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/request-hoppscotch-ok.gif"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

JSON Response:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1696783004369,
  "uuid": null,
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "message": "OK",
  "managed": true,
  "content": [
    {
      "title": "RESERVADO",
      "start": "08/09/2023 18:00",
      "end": "08/09/2023 20:00"
    },
    // ...
    // many more events
    // ...
    {
      "title": "IQ2001-Qu√≠mica Org√°nica Aplicada - Sec.1 - TEO - Grupo 1 - Docente\tJuan Carlos Rodr√≠guez",
      "start": "07/11/2023 16:00",
      "end": "07/11/2023 18:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

So far, so good! We know how to retrieve data from any client (not just `reserva-intranet.utec.edu.pe`) by making a request.

Now, let's discover how we can modify the request to obtain only the data we need.

The only variables that change here are the query parameters, which are as follows:

- `codaula`: the code of the classroom. `1622`?
- `fechainicial`: the start date of the events. In this case, `08/09/2023`
- `fechafinal`: the end date of the events. In this case, `08/11/2023`

Let's try changing the start and end dates.

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/request-hoppscotch-ok-03-10.gif"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

JSON Response:

```json {15}
{
  "timestamp": 1696784734935,
  "uuid": null,
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "message": "OK",
  "managed": true,
  "content": [
    {
      "title": ":Mantenimiento TI",
      "start": "04/10/2023 13:00",
      "end": "04/10/2023 15:00"
    },
    {
      "title": "BI0034-Procesamiento y M√©todos de Im√°genes Biom√©dicas - Sec.1 - TEO - Grupo 1 - Docente\tPedro Crisostomo",
      "start": "03/10/2023 07:00",
      "end": "03/10/2023 09:00"
    },
    // ... 13 more
    // 16 in total
    {
      "title": "IQ2001-Qu√≠mica Org√°nica Aplicada - Sec.1 - TEO - Grupo 1 - Docente\tJuan Carlos Rodr√≠guez",
      "start": "03/10/2023 16:00",
      "end": "03/10/2023 18:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

As expected, the response changed. Now we're getting the events for October 3rd and 4th of 2023.

So, we can conclude that the `fechainicial` and `fechafinal` params are the start and end dates of the events.

In important note on datetime formats here.

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/response-calendar-intranet.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the UTEC Reservas app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023. Event for course BI0034 is highlighted."
/>

In the JSON response, the event with `title` 'BI0034...' has a `start` property with value of `03/10/2023 07:00` and `end` of `03/10/2023 09:00`. This datetime formats match the UI of the UTEC Reservas app.

<Aside emoji="üëÅÔ∏è">
  UTEC Classrooms is deployed in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and the database
  is hosted in [Xata](https://xata.io/). Both services are located in the US. In
  order to keep the datetime formats consistent, we use UTC datetimes in our
  database. The conversion is done using [this utility you can see in
  GitHub](https://github.com/cuevantn/utec-classrooms/blob/master/src/lib/utils/parse-datetime.js).
</Aside>

Now, let's find out where the `codaula` param comes from.

Let's reload the page, clear the network tab, and select `Aulas` in `Tipo de Ambiente`.

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/fetch-request-utec-api-aulas.gif"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

A request is made to `/reserva-api/filtro/aula/reservable/tipoaula`. With the query params `codsede=2&codtipoaula=41`

JSON Response

```json {14-17}
{
  "timestamp": 1696785539271,
  "uuid": null,
  "status": 200,
  "error": null,
  "message": "OK",
  "managed": true,
  "content": [
    {
      "codAula": 2668,
      "nomAliasAula": "A101(40)"
    },
    /// ...
    {
      "codAula": 1622,
      "nomAliasAula": "A803(47)"
    },
    // ...
    {
      "codAula": 2677,
      "nomAliasAula": "A908(45)"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response object has a `content` property, which is an array of objects. Each object has a `codAula` property, which is an id for the classroom, and a `nomAliasAula` property, which is the name of the classroom.

In the highlighted lines, we can see that the classroom `A803` has the id `1622`.

We can use this data to programmatically get the events for a particular classroom.

Want to get the events for the classroom `A101` on October 10rd, 2023?

Here's the code:

```js
(async () => {
  const queryparams = new URLSearchParams({
    codaula: "2668", // Classroom A101
    fechainicial: "10/10/2023",
    fechafinal: "10/10/2023",
  });

  const utec_token = "eyJhb...";

  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.utec.edu.pe/reserva-api/calendarioaula/eventos?${queryparams.toString()}`,
      {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          "X-Auth-Token": utec_token,
        },
      }
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
})();
```

<Aside emoji="üî•">
  Try the code in your browser console. You'll need to replace the `utec_token`
  value with [your own token](#how-to-get-the-token). Go to
  [reserva-intranet.utec.edu.pe](https://reserva-intranet.utec.edu.pe/reserva/calendarioaula)
  and start hacking now!
</Aside>

### Where do we store the data?

Ok. Now we know how to get the data. But, where do we store it?

We're using [Xata](https://xata.io) for this project. It's my go-to database service since I discovered it.

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/xata-io.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

To begin, we need to create a new workspace for the project. We'll call it `utec-classrooms`. Then, we need to create a new database. We'll call it `utec-classrooms` (not very creative, I know). And finally, we need to define the schema for the database.

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/xata-schema.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

<Aside emoji="üî•">
  Xata has a very intuitive UI for defining the schema of a database.
</Aside>

The JSON representation of this schema is the following:

```json showLineNumbers {4,31,47,68}
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "name": "classroom",
      "columns": [

          "type": "string",
          "unique": true
        },
        {
          "name": "code",

        }
      ],

        {
          "column": "classroom",
          "table": "event"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "host",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "string",
          "unique": true
        }
      ],
      "revLinks": [
        {
          "column": "host",
          "table": "event"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "course",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "string",
          "defaultValue": "error"
        },
        {
          "name": "code",
          "type": "string",
          "unique": true
        }
      ],
      "revLinks": [
        {
          "column": "course",
          "table": "event"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "event",
      "columns": [
        {
          "name": "course",
          "type": "link",
          "link": {
            "table": "course"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "host",
          "type": "link",
          "link": {
            "table": "host"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "classroom",
          "type": "link",
          "link": {
            "table": "classroom"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "name",
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "name": "start",
          "type": "datetime"
        },
        {
          "name": "end",
          "type": "datetime"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `classroom`: represents a classroom. It has a `name` and a `code`. The `code` is the id we saw earlier.
- `host`: represents the host of the event. It has a `name`.
- `course`: represents the course of the event. It has a `name` and a `code`.
- `event`: represents an event. It has a `name`, a `start` datetime, an `end` datetime, a `classroom`, a `host`, and a `course` references.

Most of the events are classes for courses. However, there are also events for maintenance, office hours, and external events.

The classes will be stored in the `course` table. And we can reference them in the `event` table using the `course` column.

### Storing the data

The hole project is developed in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications.

This post isn't intended to be a tutorial on how to do replicate this project. The full source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cuevantn/utec-classrooms). You can check it out if you want to learn more about how I built this app.

But, I'll show you how some interesting parts of the code.

First, let's check the `src/routes/api/refresh/+server.js` file:

```js
// ...
export async function POST({ url }) {
	try {
		let classroom_name = url.searchParams.get('classroom_name') ?? 'A101';
		let utec_token = url.searchParams.get('utec_token') ?? UTEC_TOKEN;

		let classroom = await xata.db.classroom.filter({ name: classroom_name }).getFirstOrThrow();

		if (!classroom.code) {
			throw new Error(`Classroom ${classroom_name} xata record has no code.`);
		}
    // ...
  }
// ...
}
// ...
```

As you can guess, here we're definit an API route. It's a `POST` route, and receives two query params: `classroom_name` and `utec_token`.

- `classroom_name`: the name of the classroom. `A101` by default.
- `utec_token`: a token to authenticate with the UTEC API.

We're using the `xata` client to query the database. We're filtering the `classroom` table by the `name` column, and getting the first record. If there's no record, we throw an error.

```js
// ...
let queryparams = new URLSearchParams({
  codaula: String(classroom.code),
  fechainicial: todayMinus3.toLocaleDateString("en-GB", {
    timeZone: "America/Lima",
  }),
  fechafinal: todayPlus7.toLocaleDateString("en-GB", {
    timeZone: "America/Lima",
  }),
});

let response = await fetch(
  `https://api.utec.edu.pe/reserva-api/calendarioaula/eventos?${queryparams.toString()}`,
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "X-Auth-Token": utec_token,
    },
  }
);

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`UTEC API returned ${response.status}`);
}

let data = await response.json();
// ...
```

In order to obtain the events, we need to make a request to the UTEC API. We're using the `fetch` API to make the request. We're retrieving the events for the classroom from 3 days ago to 7 days from now.

```js
// ...
let existing_events_page = await xata.db.event
  .select(["*", "course.*", "host.*", "classroom.*"])
  .filter({
    $all: [
      {
        "classroom.id": classroom.id,
      },
      {
        start: {
          $ge: todayMinus5,
        },
      },
      {
        end: {
          $le: todayPlus9,
        },
      },
    ],
  })
  .getPaginated({
    pagination: {
      size: 200,
    },
  });
// ...
```

To avoid, duplicates, we first query the database to retrieve the events in that classroom between 5 days ago and 9 days from now.

After that, some filters are applied to the data. The new events are parsed and stored in the database.

```js
// ...
let created_events = await xata.db.event.create(
  events_to_create.filter((e) => e !== null)
);

return new Response(
  JSON.stringify({
    created: created_events.length,
  }),
  {
    status: 200,
  }
);
// ...
```

If we apply the same process to all the classrooms (as done in the `/api/robot` route), out database will look like this:

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/utec-classrooms/xata-events-data.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the app showing the events in the classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023"
/>

### Querying the data

We have the data in Xata.

We can query the database with its JS SDK and get only the data we need.

For example, to get the events in classroom A803 on October 3rd, 2023, we can do the following...

In JavaScript:

```js title="Query in JS"
let events = await xata.db.event
  .select(["name", "course.name", "start", "end"])
  .filter({
    $all: [
      {
        "classroom.name": "A803",
      },
      {
        start: {
          $ge: new Date("2023-10-03T11:00:00Z"), // October 3rd, 6:00 AM in Lima
        },
      },
      {
        end: {
          $le: new Date("2023-10-04T03:00:00Z"), // October 3rd, 10:00 PM in Lima
        },
      },
    ],
  })
  .getAll();
```

In SQL:

```sql title="Query in SQL"
SELECT
    "event"."name",
    "event"."start",
    "event"."end",
    "course"."name" as "course.name"

FROM
    "event"
    LEFT JOIN "classroom" ON "event"."classroom" = "classroom"."id"
    LEFT JOIN "course" ON "event"."course" = "course"."id"

WHERE
    "classroom"."name" = 'A803'
    AND "event"."start" >= '2023-10-03T11:00:00Z'
    AND "event"."end" <= '2023-10-04T03:00:00Z';
```

An it means:

```human title="Query in Human Language"
Get
  the name, start time, end time, and course name
of events
  in classroom A803
  that start on or after October 3rd at 06:00 am
  and end on or before 10:00 pm (Lima time).
```

Easy, right?

That's why I love Xata.

## The algorithm

Now that we know how to get the data, let's talk about how we can use it to find the free classrooms.
