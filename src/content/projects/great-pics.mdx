# GreatPics

<ViewAppButton href="https://www.greatpics.app/" />

Great pics is a web applcation that uses AI to generate alt text for your pictures. It's build using Next.js, OpenAI, Xata, UploadThing, Upstash, and Tailwind CSS.

## How it works

<FullImage
  src="/assets/projects/greatpics/upload-process-dark.png"
  alt="Upload image process"
  lightSrc="/assets/projects/greatpics/upload-process-light.png"
/>

I'm actively working on Classhub, a social network exclusively for students. At registration, the user must enter a valid university email address. This way, we can ensure that only students can register.

## Usage

<ImageGallery
  images={[
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/landing.png",
      alt: "Landing page",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/pic-input.png",
      alt: "Picture input",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/pic-choosen.png",
      alt: "Picture choosen",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/pic-processing.png",
      alt: "Picture processing",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/context-input.png",
      alt: "Input context",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/context-input-completed.png",
      alt: "Input context completed",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/processing.png",
      alt: "Processing",
    },
    {
      src: "/assets/projects/greatpics/finished.png",
      alt: "Finished",
    },
  ]}
  className="mb-4"
/>

- [x] **Create posts**: You can create posts with images, text, and code snippets.
- [x] **Search**: You can search for posts by title, content, or tags.

## How it works

it's so cool `hello()`

```ts showLineNumbers title="src/pages/api/posts/[id]/images.ts"  {6-10, 13}
let images = [];

let i = 0;
while (true) {
  let file = form_data.get(`file-${i}`);
  let alt = form_data.get(`alt-${i}`);

  if (!file) {
    break;
  }

  file = file as File;

  let fileName: string = file.name;
  let mimeType = file.type;
  let fileData = Buffer.from(await file.arrayBuffer());

  images.push({
    alt: alt ? alt.toString() : null,
    file: {
      name: fileName,
      mediaType: mimeType,
      base64Content: fileData.toString("base64"),
    },
    status: newStatus.id,
  });

  i++;
}

await xata.db.image.create(images);
```
